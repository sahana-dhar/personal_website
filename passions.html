      <h3>AI for Social Impact</h3>
      <p>
        I'm deeply passionate about using artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems that matter. 
        My work with the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs showed me how 
        generative AI can transform public sector operations, making services more accessible and efficient 
        for citizens. I believe technology should be a force for good, democratizing access to powerful tools 
        and insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's building AI platforms that reduce development time from weeks to minutes, or creating 
        educational curricula that help 1,100+ learners understand and leverage AI, I'm committed to making 
        AI more accessible, responsible, and impactful.
      </p>

      <h3>Behavioral Neuroscience & Data</h3>
      <p>
        The intersection of neuroscience and data science fascinates me. How can we use machine learning to 
        understand human behavior, decision-making, and personality? My award-winning research on the Five 
        Factor Model of Personality and its relationship to drug habits explored exactly this—using statistical 
        models to uncover patterns in human behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm particularly interested in how behavioral data can inform better interventions, whether in public 
        health, education, or customer engagement. Understanding the "why" behind the numbers is what makes 
        data science meaningful.
      </p>

      <h3>Predictive Analytics & ML</h3>
      <p>
        Building machine learning models that achieve 95% accuracy in predicting customer churn isn't just 
        about the numbers—it's about understanding what drives human behavior and engagement. I love the 
        challenge of feature engineering, model selection, and finding the right balance between complexity 
        and interpretability.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Random Forest and XGBoost models for customer analytics to ensemble methods for educational 
        outcomes, I'm passionate about creating models that are both powerful and actionable. The best 
        models don't just predict—they provide insights that drive real business and social impact.
      </p>

      <h3>Education & Knowledge Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        Teaching AI and data science to 1,100+ learners at The Roux Institute has been one of my most 
        rewarding experiences. I'm passionate about making complex technical concepts accessible and 
        actionable. Whether it's Python programming, prompt engineering, or machine learning fundamentals, 
        I believe everyone can benefit from understanding how AI works.
      </p>
      <p>
        I design hands-on learning modules that bridge the gap between theory and practice, helping 
        professionals transform their understanding into real-world applications. Education is the key 
        to responsible AI adoption and innovation.

      <h3>Full-Stack Development</h3>
      <p>
        I love building end-to-end solutions—from data pipelines in AWS to full-stack applications like 
        Talentia. There's something satisfying about taking a problem from concept to deployment, working 
        with everything from SQL databases and REST APIs to Docker containers and cloud infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building the Talentia platform taught me how to think about user experience, system architecture, 
        and scalable design. I enjoy the challenge of making complex backend systems feel simple and 
        intuitive to users.

      <h3>Data-Driven Social Good</h3>
      <p>
        My projects on student retention in higher education and environmental risk indicators reflect my 
        commitment to using data science for social good. I'm passionate about identifying patterns that 
        can inform better policies, interventions, and resource allocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether analyzing factors that drive educational equity or predicting environmental vulnerability, 
        I believe data science has a crucial role to play in creating a more equitable and sustainable 
        world. The goal isn't just to build models—it's to drive change.

    <h2>Why These Passions Matter</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Combining technical excellence with human-centered impact</p>
  </div>

  <div class="about-content">
    <p>
      My dual major in Data Science and Behavioral Neuroscience reflects a fundamental belief: the most 
      powerful applications of technology come from understanding both the technical possibilities and the 
      human context. I don't just build models—I think about who will use them, what problems they solve, 
      and how they can be made more accessible and responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I'm working on customer churn prediction at Tenerity, building AI platforms for state 
      agencies, or teaching AI fundamentals to professionals, I bring this human-centered approach. 
      Technology should amplify human potential, not replace it. That's why I'm passionate about 
      creating solutions that are powerful, ethical, and accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I continue my journey, I'm excited to work on problems that combine technical rigor with 
      meaningful impact. From generative AI for public services to predictive models that inform 
      better educational outcomes, I'm committed to building a career at the intersection of 
      innovation and social good.
